# Guy's Minesweeper solver/generator

This is an implementation of the [classic Minesweeper game]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game))
in ruby.

It has three scripts:
 - computer_plays, takes a dimension and number of bombs as arguments
 and displays the computer attempting to solve the given puzzle.

 - human_plays, takes a dimension and number of bombs as arguments
 and allows a human player to attempt to solve a minesweeper game
 with those parameters.

 - harness, allows you to benchmark the computer player.
 It takes a third parameter, attempts, and it measures the time taken
 and the success rate of the computer player solving that many puzzles.
